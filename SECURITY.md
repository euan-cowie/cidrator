- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability in Cidrator`
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours

### üîí GitHub Security Advisories

You can also report vulnerabilities through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to [Security Advisories](https://github.com/euan-cowie/cidrator/security/advisories)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the private advisory form

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What NOT to Do

- **Do NOT** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- **Do NOT** discuss security issues in public forums or social media
- **Do NOT** share vulnerability details until we've had time to address them

## üéØ What Qualifies as a Security Vulnerability

We consider the following as security vulnerabilities:

### **High Priority**
- Remote code execution
- Local privilege escalation
- Authentication bypass
- Unauthorized data access
- Memory corruption vulnerabilities
- Injection attacks (command injection, etc.)

### **Medium Priority**
- Information disclosure (sensitive data)
- Denial of service vulnerabilities
- Path traversal attacks
- Input validation issues leading to unexpected behavior

### **Low Priority**
- Information disclosure (non-sensitive data)
- Rate limiting issues
- Minor input validation issues

### **Not Security Issues**
- Feature requests
- Performance issues (unless DoS-related)
- Configuration issues
- User error
- Issues requiring physical access to the system

## üîç Security Features

Cidrator includes several security features:

### **Input Validation**
- Comprehensive CIDR format validation
- IP address format validation
- Safe limits on operations (preventing memory exhaustion)
- Sanitized error messages (no sensitive data leakage)

### **Safe Defaults**
- Automatic safety limits on large range operations
- Memory-safe operations using Go's built-in protections
- No external network requests by default
- Read-only operations on network data

### **Build Security**
- Dependencies are regularly updated
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Reproducible builds
- Code signing for releases

## üìã Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported | End of Life |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Yes    | TBD         |
