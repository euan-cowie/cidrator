# Contributing to Cidrator

🎉 **Thank you for contributing!** 🎉

We've made contributing as simple as possible. You can be productive in under 5 minutes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cidrator.git
cd cidrator

# 2. One-time setup
make setup

# 3. Make your changes, then test
make dev

# 4. Run quality checks
make check

# 5. Commit and push
git commit -m "feat: your awesome change"
git push origin your-branch-name
```

**That's it!** Create a PR and we'll review it.

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
make help           # Show all commands
make dev            # Quick build + test (use this most)
make run ARGS="..." # Test your changes
make check          # Full checks before PR
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### golangci-lint: command not found

If you see this error after running `make setup`:

**Quick fix:**
```bash
# Restart your terminal, OR
source ~/.zshrc    # for zsh (macOS default)
source ~/.bash_profile  # for bash
```

**Manual fix if needed:**
```bash
# Add Go's bin directory to your PATH
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Why this happens:** golangci-lint installs to `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` (usually `~/go/bin`), but this directory might not be in your shell's PATH. Our setup script tries to fix this automatically, but sometimes requires a terminal restart.

### Other Common Issues

**Tests failing after setup:**
```bash
make clean && make build && make test
```

**Dependencies out of sync:**
```bash
go mod download && go mod tidy
```

**Can't find `make` command:**
- **macOS:** Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
- **Linux:** Install build-essential: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`

**Wrong Go version:**
- Cidrator requires Go 1.24.5
- Check: `go version`
- Update: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)

## 📝 Commit Messages

Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
feat: add awesome feature
fix: resolve memory leak
docs: update readme
test: add unit tests
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Quick test during development
make test-quick

# Full tests before PR
make test

# Linux namespace MTU lab
make test-lab

# Linux hop-by-hop MTU lab
make test-lab-hops

# Linux ICMP black-hole PLPMTUD lab
make test-lab-plpmtud

# Test your changes manually
make run ARGS="cidr explain 192.168.1.0/24"
```

## 🎯 What to Work On

**Good first issues:** Look for the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/euan-cowie/cidrator/labels/good%20first%20issue) label

**High-impact areas:**
- **DNS Tools** (`cmd/dns/`) - Broaden record coverage and diagnostics
- **MTU Tooling** (`cmd/mtu/`) - Reliability, portability, and output polish
- **Output Formats** - CSV, XML support
- **Tests** - Always appreciated!
